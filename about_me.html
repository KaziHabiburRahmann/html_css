<p>
Man is a traveler by nature. He does not like to keep static at a place for a long time. So, people like to visit new places whenever they find time and opportunity. People travel for different purposes. Some travel for getting an education and some travel for pleasure. Many people also travel for business and employment. Travelling is, indeed, very pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we can know new people and learn many new things. Travelling opens new vistas of experience and understanding for us.
